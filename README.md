**Course:** Scientific Computing for Probability, Statistics, and Data Science  
**Institution:** CIMAT – Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas  
**Term:** Fall 2024 

This repository contains all course assignments and the final project from the graduate-level class *Scientific Computing for Probability, Statistics, and Data Science* at CIMAT (Fall 2024). The course was taught by my thesis advisor and significantly influenced the computational direction of my master's thesis, which focuses on solving inverse problems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

## Repository Structure

Each assignment comprises the following elements:

- Python scripts with modular implementations of the required models and methods.
- A `report.pdf` that explains the methodology and findings.
- A `results/` directory with visual representations of the results.  

---

## Technical Stack

This project was developed using:

- Python 3.11+
- Key dependencies: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `pandas`, etc.
- It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

> Note: Each assignment may include additional libraries specified in the corresponding script headers.

## Overview of Assignments

The following section presents a concise overview of each task, highlighting its primary objective:

- **Assignment 1 – LU and Cholesky Decomposition**  
  Implementation of forward/backward substitution, LUP decomposition with pivoting, and Cholesky factorization. Includes performance comparison over increasing matrix sizes.

  </div>

- **Assignment 2 – QR Decomposition and Least Squares**  
  Implementation of the modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm and its application to solve linear regression problems via QR decomposition. Includes polynomial fitting with varying degrees and sample sizes, and a performance comparison between the custom implementation and SciPy's QR routine.

  </div>

- **Assignment 3 – Numerical Stability**  
  Analysis of numerical stability in Cholesky decomposition under perturbations. The task explores how matrix conditioning affects the results of QR-based least squares solutions. Includes timing comparisons and estimator sensitivity under both well-conditioned and ill-conditioned scenarios.

- **Assignment 4 – Eigenvalue Computation**  
  Application of Gershgorin’s theorem to estimate eigenvalue locations and implementation of the QR iteration algorithm to numerically compute eigenvalues. Includes comparisons with SciPy’s `eig` function across perturbation levels, confirming the accuracy and limitations of the custom QR method.

- **Assignment 5 – Stochastic Simulation**  
  Exploration of methods for sampling from distributions, including inverse transform sampling, linear congruential generators, and SciPy’s discrete random utilities. The assignment culminates with a full implementation of Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS), applied to simulate from Gamma(2,1), Normal, and Beta distributions with high accuracy.

- **Assignment 6 – MCMC: Metropolis-Hastings**  
  Simulation of Bernoulli data and posterior inference for the parameter \( p \) using Metropolis-Hastings. Two proposal distributions were implemented: a Beta prior-informed proposal and a truncated Normal centered at the current state. The task includes analysis of irreducibility and ergodicity, along with convergence behavior as sample size increases.

- **Assignment 7 – Metropolis-Hastings in Multivariate Settings**  
  Implementation of Metropolis-Hastings for bivariate and Gamma distributions, including random walk proposals and convergence diagnostics under different sample sizes and proposal variances.

- **Assignment 8 – MCMC with Hybrid Kernels and Gibbs Sampling**  
  Simulation from complex posteriors using hybrid Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs samplers. Includes examples with bivariate normals, Weibull likelihoods, and hierarchical Poisson-Gamma models for nuclear pump failure data.

- **Final Project – Bayesian Inference for Weibull Parameters**  
  Full Bayesian treatment of a Weibull likelihood using MCMC. Implements both standard Metropolis-Hastings and adaptive proposals for posterior sampling of \(\alpha\) and \(\lambda\), with convergence diagnostics and posterior summaries for simulated datasets.
