# Scientific Computing â€“ CIMAT (Fall 2024)

**Author:** Ezau Faridh Torres Torres  
**Advisor:** Dr. JosÃ© AndrÃ©s Christen Gracia  
**Course:** Scientific Computing for Probability, Statistics, and Data Science  
**Institution:** CIMAT â€“ Centro de InvestigaciÃ³n en MatemÃ¡ticas  
**Term:** Fall 2024 

This repository contains all course assignments and the final project from the graduate-level class *Scientific Computing for Probability, Statistics, and Data Science* at CIMAT (Fall 2024). The course was taught by my thesis advisor and significantly influenced the computational direction of my master's thesis, which focuses on solving inverse problems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

## Repository Structure

Each assignment comprises the following elements:

- Python scripts with modular implementations of the required models and methods.
- A `report.pdf` that explains the methodology and findings.
- A `results/` directory with visual representations of the results.  

---

## Technical Stack

This project was developed using:

- Python 3.11+
- Key dependencies: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `pandas`, etc.
- It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

> Note: Each assignment may include additional libraries specified in the corresponding script headers.
